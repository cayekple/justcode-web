# HTML 5 Tags Definition and Usage
All HTML documents must start with a ``<!DOCTYPE>`` declaration.
In HTML 5, the declaration is simplified.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

## <html>
The ``<html>`` tag is the root of an HTML document.
  
## <head>
The ``<head>`` element is a container for metadata about the website.

## <title>
The ``<title>`` tag defines the title of the HTML document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the web browser's title.

The ``<title>`` tag is required in HTML documents!

## <body>
  
## <header>
  
## <main>
  
## <footer>

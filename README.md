# HTML 5 Tags Definition and Usage
All HTML documents must start with a ``<!DOCTYPE>`` declaration.

In HTML 5, the declaration is simplified.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

## <html>
The ``<html>`` tag is the root of an HTML document.
  
## <head>
The ``<head>`` element is a container for metadata about the website.

## <title>
The ``<title>`` tag defines the title of the HTML document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the web browser's title.

The ``<title>`` tag is required in HTML documents.

## <body>
The ``<body>`` tag defines the document's body.

## <header>
The ``<header>`` element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.

A ``<header>`` element typically contains:

- one or more heading elements (``<h1> - <h6>``)
- logo or icon
- authorship information

## <main>
The ``<main>`` tag specifies the main content of a document.

The content inside the ``<main>`` element should be unique to the document. It should not contain any content that is repeated across documents such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms.
  
## <footer>
The ``<footer>`` tag defines a footer for a document or section.

A ``<footer>`` element typically contains:

- authorship information

- back to top links
- related documents

You can have several ``<footer>`` elements in one document.
